Tata 1mg Medicines Market Analysis Project
Overview
This project aims to gather data from the Tata 1mg website using web scraping techniques, prepare and merge the data in Excel, and finally, visualize the data using Power BI for comprehensive market analysis of medicines available on Tata 1mg.

Project Steps
Web Scraping using BeautifulSoup and Selenium

We utilized Python libraries BeautifulSoup and Selenium to scrape data from the Tata 1mg website.
BeautifulSoup was used to parse the HTML content of the web pages and extract relevant information such as medicine names, prices, descriptions, etc.
Selenium was employed to automate interactions with the website, including navigating through pages, handling dynamic content, and triggering data retrieval.
Data Preparation and Merging in Excel

The scraped data was organized and cleaned in Python to ensure data quality.
We then exported the cleaned data to Excel files for further processing.
Data from various web pages or sections of the Tata 1mg website was merged into a single Excel spreadsheet.
Excel was also used for additional data transformations, calculations, and data validation if necessary.
Power BI for Data Visualization

Power BI was utilized for creating interactive and visually appealing data visualizations.
We imported the cleaned and merged data from Excel into Power BI.
Various types of charts, graphs, and tables were created to visualize insights and trends in the medicines market.
Filters, slicers, and drill-through functionalities were implemented to allow users to explore the data interactively.
